# Hey there! 
I’m Erika — data lover, adventure chaser, and forever curious human.

I’ve explored 36 countries (so far!) and studied everything from regression models to global markets. I'm driven by a deep curiosity about people, cultures, and how numbers can help us make better decisions.

## Why this site exists:
Because I believe in solving problems with data, telling better stories, and making life a little more adventurous both in work and beyond.

## Stick around for:

Practical, creative data projects

Honest reflections on growth and leadership

Real travel recs from someone who’s always chasing what’s next

Let’s make data an adventure.
