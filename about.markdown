## Hey there! 🌎✈️

Welcome to my little corner of the internet — where **data meets adventure**, and curiosity leads the way.

I’m Erika:  
- A stats major with a serious case of wanderlust  
- A global explorer who's traveled to **36 countries** (and still hungry for more!)  
- A creative problem solver who loves working with people, numbers, and new cultures

### Why I started this site
I believe in using data and storytelling to connect people, solve real-world problems, and explore the unknown — whether that’s a new country or a new dataset.


### What you'll find here:
- Data-driven projects that solve cool problems  
- Behind-the-scenes insights into how I learn, lead, and grow on the go
- Travel stories & tips from a well-stamped passport  

Thanks for being here. This is more than just a blog — it’s a travel journal, a creative outlet, and an open invitation to connect. So whether you’re here for the adventure or the analytics, I hope you stay a while.
