## Inside the Rank of Top Sneakers
In my first post, I asked: What makes a sneaker a hit? I explored how factors like price, rank, and release year influence popularity. But I knew there was more to uncover.

So I expanded the dataset through additional webscraping, adding color, designer, exact release date, and shoe category. Now I’m back with part two: a deeper dive into what top-performing sneakers actually look like and what goes into making a top-ranking shoe.

## What Actually Correlates with Popularity?
To dig deeper, I ran a linear model predicting sneaker rank based on variables like price, release date, designer, main color, technology, and category. It was important to me to understand what really drives these rankings. 

Below I've included my code I ran in R for a linear model:

```r
lm(formula = rank ~ price + daysfrommarch + Designer + Main.Color + Technology + Category, data = goatdata)
```

## Key Findings from the Model
This model allowed me to focus on the most significant variables. Below I'll be talking about: price, release date, designer, color, and technology and how each one impacts shoe ranking. Let's get into it. 

Price: Slight negative correlation with rank. 
More expensive shoes tend to rank slightly better (lower rank = more popular).

 → Estimate: -0.12, p = 0.03

Release Date: Newer releases are generally more popular.
This makes complete sense to me, if a new shoe is released in February, it'll probably be popular in March. I've included a chart showing the release date by the count of items in the top 182 ranking. 

 → Estimate: -0.05, p < 0.001

#### Designers that stand out:
Tinker Hatfield and Kanye West were significantly associated with higher-performing shoes.
 
 → Tinker: Estimate: -31.9, p = 0.026

 → Kanye: Estimate: -65.9, p = 0.014


#### Color Trends:

Most colors weren’t statistically significant.

But a few stood out:

Multi-color shoes surprisingly did well.
 
 → Estimate: +53.9, p = 0.041

Silver performed poorly.
 
 → Estimate: -58.0, p = 0.034

#### Tech Takeaways:

Gel, Air, and ABZORB technologies were associated with lower rank (i.e., better performance).
 
 → Gel: p = 0.003, Air: p = 0.019, ABZORB: p = 0.041




## What Colors Dominate the Sneaker Scene?
One of the first things I asked was: Are top shoes loud and bold—or clean and classic?
The answer is pretty clear:

Black reigns supreme, appearing over 50 times among the top 182 sneakers in my dataset. White is a close second, followed by neutral tones like grey, brown, and cream.
Vibrant hues like orange, teal, and yellow are far less common. It seems that shoppers (and resellers) favor versatile, everyday kicks over bold statement pieces.

### Why Does This Matter?
Wearability wins: Neutral colors are easier to style, making them more desirable for everyday use.

Timelessness sells: Black and white sneakers—think Air Force 1s, Yeezys, and Jordans—are safe bets with lasting appeal.

Bold ≠ Better (for resale): Eye-catching colorways may turn heads, but they don't always top the resale charts.



## Top Designers: Who’s Behind the Hype?
#### Tinker Hatfield
Nike legend. Architect-turned-sneaker-genius. He brought us the visible Air bubble and iconic Jordans. His designs blend innovation, story, and swagger—and sneakerheads love him for it. Hatfield joined Nike in 1981 as a corporate architect and made the jump to shoe design just a few years later. His Air Jordan III saved Nike’s relationship with Michael Jordan, and from there, he went on to design many of the most beloved Jordans—III through XV and beyond—as well as classics like the Air Max 1, Air Trainer, and MAG. Tinker made sneakers collectible, wearable art.

#### Peter Moore
The man who gave the world the Air Jordan 1 and the Nike Dunk. Peter Moore was Nike's first-ever creative director and a foundational figure in sneaker culture. He created the Jumpman logo and set the stage for the Jordan brand as we know it. Later, he left Nike to work with Adidas, where he helped rejuvenate the brand by co-founding Adidas Equipment (EQT) and giving the brand a performance-driven edge in the '90s. His designs—bold, functional, and ahead of their time—bridged the gap between sport and lifestyle. While his name isn’t as hyped as Tinker’s, his impact runs deep.

#### Kanye West
The Yeezy mastermind. Kanye didn’t just make shoes—he reshaped sneaker culture. After brief design collabs with Nike, Kanye fully stepped into the sneaker spotlight with Adidas, launching Yeezy in 2015. The Yeezy Boost 350 became a cultural phenomenon, redefining what a "hyped" sneaker could look like—minimalist, earthy, post-apocalyptic. More than just a rapper with a shoe line, Ye positioned himself as a creative director, overseeing silhouettes, campaigns, and drops. His blend of scarcity, mystery, and fashion-forward design made Yeezy a billion-dollar brand—and cemented his place in sneaker history.

#### Eric Avar
The quiet innovator. Avar has been shaping performance footwear at Nike for over two decades, particularly in the basketball world. He’s the design brain behind most of Kobe Bryant’s signature shoes, known for their low-profile, lightweight construction that pushed how performance shoes looked and felt. Avar doesn’t chase trends—he sets them. With a deep focus on athlete input and technical performance, he’s earned a cult following among hoopers and design insiders alike. From the Zoom Huarache 2K4 to the Kobe 9 Elite, Avar’s work defines the evolution of modern basketball shoes.
