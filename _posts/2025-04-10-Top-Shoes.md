# Inside the Rank of Top Sneakers
In my first post, I asked: What makes a sneaker a hit? I explored how factors like price, rank, and release year influence popularity. But I knew there was more to uncover.

So I expanded the dataset through additional webscraping, adding color, designer, exact release date, and shoe category. Now I’m back with part two: a deeper dive into what top-performing sneakers actually look like and what goes into making a top-ranking shoe. 

If you'd like to explore my data on your own, check out my <a href="https://shoeanalysis-rnwj4avdumr7xmuccjtaow.streamlit.app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steamlit app!</a>

# What Actually Correlates with Popularity?
To dig deeper, I ran a linear model predicting sneaker rank based on variables like price, release date, designer, main color, technology, and category. It was important to me to understand what really drives these rankings. 

Below I've included my code I ran in R for a linear model:

```r
lm(formula = rank ~ price + daysfrommarch + Designer + Main.Color + Technology + Category, data = goatdata)
```

# Key Findings from the Model
This model allowed me to focus on the most significant variables. 

Below I'll be talking about: price, release date, designer, color, and technology and how each one impacts shoe ranking. Let's get into it. 

### Price of Shoe 
We observe a slight negative correlation with rank. More expensive shoes tend to rank slightly better (lower rank = more popular).

 → Estimate: -0.12, p = 0.03

### Release Date Matters (duh!)
Newer releases are generally more popular. This makes complete sense to me, if a new shoe is released in February, it'll probably be popular in March. However, we can observe in the chart that there are always a few outliers that stay popular for years (hello 2018 I see you in there). I've included a chart showing the release date by the count of items in the top 182 ranking. 

 → Estimate: -0.05, p < 0.001

### Who’s Behind the Hype? Designers!
Tinker Hatfield and Kanye West were significantly associated with higher-performing shoes.
 
 → Tinker: Estimate: -31.9, p = 0.026

 → Kanye: Estimate: -65.9, p = 0.014

 We see other designers who are also very popular and have multiple shoes in the top list. Let's learn a little more about them!

    <h4>Tinker Hatfield</h4>
    <p>Nike legend. Architect-turned-designer. He brought us the visible Air bubble and iconic Jordans. After joining Nike in 1981, he switched to shoe design and saved the Nike–MJ partnership with the Air Jordan III. From Jordans III–XV to the Air Max 1 and MAG, Tinker made sneakers into collectible, wearable art.</p>

    <h4>Peter Moore</h4>
    <p>Creator of the Air Jordan 1, Nike Dunk, and the Jumpman logo. As Nike’s first creative director, he helped shape the Jordan brand before moving to Adidas, where he co-founded EQT and drove a performance-first focus in the ’90s. His bold, functional designs bridged sport and lifestyle and changed sneaker culture forever.</p>

    <h4>Kanye West</h4>
    <p>The Yeezy mastermind. Kanye didn’t just design sneakers, he transformed the hype game. After early Nike collabs, he launched Yeezy with Adidas in 2015. The minimalist, earthy Yeezy Boost 350 became a cultural icon. His tight control over design, drops, and branding turned Yeezy into a billion-dollar empire.</p>

    <h4>Eric Avar</h4>
    <p>Nike’s quiet innovator. Avar shaped modern performance footwear, especially in basketball. He designed most of Kobe Bryant’s signature shoes—lightweight, low-profile, and game-changing. With a focus on athlete input and technical design, his work (from the Huarache 2K4 to the Kobe 9) sets the standard for basketball sneakers.</p>

### Color Trends:

Most colors weren’t statistically significant. But a few stood out.

Multi-color shoes surprisingly did well.
 
 → Estimate: +53.9, p = 0.041

Silver performed poorly.
 
 → Estimate: -58.0, p = 0.034

However even without a strong correlation to rank, theres still obvious trends in our data. My chart shows more detail about this.

#### What Colors Dominate the Sneaker Scene?
One of the first things I asked was: Are top shoes loud and bold or clean and classic? Because of this I was really excited to explore the dataset and pay special attention to color. 

So what color is most popular? The answer is pretty clear. Black reigns supreme, appearing over 50 times among the top 182 sneakers in the dataset. White is a close second, followed by neutral tones like grey, brown, and cream.
Vibrant hues like orange, teal, and yellow are far less common. It seems that shoppers (and resellers) favor versatile, everyday kicks over bold statement pieces.


#### Why Does This Matter?
Wearability wins: Neutral colors are easier to style, making them more desirable for everyday use.

Timelessness sells: Black and white sneakers—think Air Force 1s, Yeezys, and Jordans—are safe bets with lasting appeal.

Bold ≠ Better (for resale): Eye-catching colorways may turn heads, but they don't always top the resale charts.



### Tech Takeaways:

Gel, Air, and ABZORB technologies were associated with lower rank (i.e., better performance).
 
 → Gel: p = 0.003, Air: p = 0.019, ABZORB: p = 0.041

My hyptohesis is that this is way more about style, trends and comfortability than the actual technology behind it.

# Final Thoughts
The takeaway? Popular sneakers aren't just about hype, they're a mix of design pedigree, wearability, and timing. While price and flash matter a little, who made the shoe, when it dropped, and how easy it is to wear are some of the biggest drivers of success.
