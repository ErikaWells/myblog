# **Introduction**

Does your college GPA determine how much you'll make in five years? What about your major? And do men and women with the same degree earn the same salary? We analyzed salary data from the American Community Survey to uncover patterns in graduate earnings five years after college. The findings are surprising and the influence on your career is even more profound.

# **Does GPA Matter?**

The short answer: yes. GPA does have an impact on salary and a higher GPA does translate into a higher salary as captured five years after graduation. However, an entire full point increase in GPA (3.0 to 4.0) at graduation only adds \$5,398 to future annual salary. To break this impact down further, every .1 increase in GPA correlates to a \$540 increase in annual salary.

Before you start obsessing over your grades, know that your major plays a much bigger role in salary outcomes. GPA matters more for some fields than others. In Engineering and Computer Science, a strong GPA can significantly boost earnings. But in Arts and Education, the impact is smaller.Â 

Check out the chart below. We can see that as the GPA increase there is some increase in salary, however, our line is not very steep, showing us that the impact isn't extremely strong.
