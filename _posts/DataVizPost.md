# Data Visualization
As a novice statistician (am I allowed to call myself that yet?) I have realized the statistical interpretation epidemic. I truly believe it’s an issue. And although this problem needs to be addressed with the general population, let's get to the root of the issue. Data visualization. It starts with us, and by that I mean the data analysts, statisticians, data scientists, or whatever you call yourself. 
	Most people look at a chart and make immediate assumptions about the data. Isn’t that what these graphical representations are for? In order to assist with this epidemic, we have to ensure that we present data in extremely deliberate ways. Not only are these visualizations essential for spreading accurate information into the great unknown, but have I also mentioned that I believe data visualization is the arts and crafts of STEM? Plus, what can be more fun than choosing the colors to represent our variables? Or what icon to represent our data points? 
	If it isn’t obvious yet, I believe data visualization is extremely important. It shapes the world we live in and the decisions we make (plus it’s super fun). So today I want to dive into this topic and give you an overview of my favorite tool for this art: Tableau. 
Tableau is a data visualization and business intelligence (BI) tool that enables users to analyze and present data in beautiful ways. Users can easily upload and connect datasets, manipulate data, create dashboards and reports, and even integrate with other software.
